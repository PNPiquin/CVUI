# CVUI

UI for basic computer vision pipelines.

## Installation

This project uses GTK and C++ GTKMM bindings to handle all the UI part. On the computer vision part, this project defines its own Matrix class so it does not depend on other projects.

It uses Cmake and comes with a CmakeFile to configure the build.

### GTKMM

This project is based on GTKMM 4.0

Please refer to http://www.gtkmm.org/en/ for installation.
